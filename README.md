Fake Credit Card Detection Using Machine Learning (Supervised Learning)

This project leverages supervised learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
A Random Forest Algorithm (RFA) was implemented to classify transactions as genuine or fraudulent based on historical data. 
The model analyzes key transaction patterns to effectively differentiate between real and fake credit card transactions.
